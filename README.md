This code implements a sentiment analysis pipeline using several simulated lexicons, a random forest classifier, and cross-validation. Here's an overview:

Key Functions and Components:
create_improved_simulated_lexicons():

Generates four lexicons: AFINN, Bing, NRC, and Loughran-McDonald.
Each lexicon contains a list of words associated with random sentiment scores or categories (e.g., "positive", "negative", emotions like "anger" or "joy").
generate_improved_sample_abstract(source):

Generates random text data with common words and sentiment keywords. It simulates text data for sentiment classification.
preprocess_text(text):

Cleans and tokenizes the input text for analysis by lowercasing, removing non-word characters, and splitting into tokens.
extract_sentiment_features(tokens, afinn, bing, nrc, loughran):

Extracts sentiment features from the tokens using the AFINN, Bing, NRC, and Loughran lexicons.
Calculates scores for each text using these lexicons and additional features like text length, unique word count, and average word length.
Main Logic:
Dataset Creation:

The dataset is created by combining random abstract texts with the simulated lexicons to form a training and test set.
Feature Extraction:

For each text, features are extracted based on sentiment scores and linguistic properties (length, average word length, unique words).
Preprocessing Pipeline:

Uses a ColumnTransformer to impute missing data (if any).
The preprocessing step feeds into a RandomForestClassifier model for classification.
Cross-Validation:

A 10-fold cross-validation is performed to evaluate the classifier.
The cross-validation accuracy is printed.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The dataset is split into training and test sets.
The random forest model is trained on the training set, predictions are made on the test set, and the classification report and confusion matrix are generated.
Evaluation:
Cross-validation and Test Set Accuracy:
It provides an overall view of how well the model performs using the features extracted from text.
The high accuracy and perfect confusion matrix you observed suggest the model fits the data extremely well.

 The result you shared indicates perfect classification metrics:

Cross-validation accuracy: 1.0000 with no variance.
Precision, Recall, F1-score: All are 1.00, meaning there are no false positives or false negatives.
Confusion matrix: Shows that the model predicted all 16 instances of "chatgpt" and 13 instances of "human" correctly with no misclassifications.
While these results look perfect, a few things to consider:

Data Size: With only 29 samples, the model might be overfitting.
Cross-validation consistency: A perfect score across folds could suggest that the model has learned specific details of your data rather than generalizing well.
